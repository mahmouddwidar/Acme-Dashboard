This repository contains the starter template I used for the [Next.js App Router Course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app). It provided the foundational code for building a full-stack financial dashboard application.

## Project Overview

Throughout the course, I developed an application that includes:

- **Public Home Page**: An accessible landing page for all users.
- **Authentication System**: Secure login functionality to protect dashboard routes.
- **Dashboard Interface**: authenticated user can:
  - View a summary of financial data.
  - Add, edit, and delete invoices.

By completing this course, I gained essential skills to build robust full-stack applications using Next.js.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18.18.0 or later**: be ensured you had the appropriate Node.js version installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download)
- **pnpm**: This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. I installed it globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
### Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmouddwidar/Acme-Dashboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ``` bash
   cd Acme-Dashboard
   ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Running the Development Server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

## Login Credentials

To access the dashboard, use the following test account:

- **Email**: user@nextmail.com
